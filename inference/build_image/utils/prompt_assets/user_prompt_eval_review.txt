Review the finalized Dockerfile and decide whether the evaluation script (`run_tests.sh`) must be updated. You are given a skeleton script that contains a placeholder `[CONTENT_OF_TEST_PATCH]`; do not modify or remove that placeholder. We will restore the actual patch content later to prevent accidental edits.

**Context**
- Final Dockerfile (after self-check):
```dockerfile
{{FINAL_DOCKERFILE}}
```
- Unified diff versus the original Dockerfile:
```diff
{{DOCKER_DIFF}}
```
- Evaluation script skeleton (patch content replaced by `[CONTENT_OF_TEST_PATCH]`):
```bash
{{ORIGINAL_EVAL_SCRIPT}}
```

**Instructions**
1. Preserve the existing validation flow; only modify the script if Dockerfile changes (paths, user, environment activation, etc.) truly require it. Keep `[CONTENT_OF_TEST_PATCH]` exactly in place; do not rewrite or expand the patch content.
2. Ensure the script activates or exports the same environment used during build (e.g., source the Python venv) so `python`/`pytest` resolve correctly.
3. Do not introduce network access or installation commands, and keep the `OMNIGRIL_EXIT_CODE` behavior unchanged.
4. If an update is required, return the full script **with `[CONTENT_OF_TEST_PATCH]` still present**. If no change is needed, return `<None>`.

**Output format (strict JSON):**
```json
{
  "eval_script": "<full script or <None>>",
  "notes": "Brief explanation of the decision; if unchanged, justify why"
}
```
